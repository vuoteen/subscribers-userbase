# subscribers-userbase
## Introduction
This project aims to showcase a custom userbase segmentation and price point analysis using SQL/PowerBI. It is based on a fictional subscription-based business model of a small company (around 50k users).

I have created a custom database 'dolphin' in MySQL Server 8.0 with four tables, generated and ingested the data. The data has then been manipulated using SQL with common table expressions, joins, aggregates, window functions and more to create a hollistic breakdown view of company's userbase. Microsoft PowerBI has been used to pull the data in order to create an interactive dashboard while seeking for valuable conclusions.
